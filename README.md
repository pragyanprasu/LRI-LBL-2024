# LRI-LBL-2024

This repository contains the numerical results presented in the paper titled *A plethora of long-range neutrino interactions probed by DUNE and T2HK* ([arXiv:2403.XXXXX](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.XXXXX)).

Our work discusses the prospects of constraining and discovering the long-range neutrino interactions with electrons, neutrons, and protons, that arise from a variety of U(1)' symmetries.  It also discusses the novel prospect of experimentally distinguishing between these symmetries. 

The results are organized in folders, which we describe below.  For details, see the Readme file inside each folder.

1. `confusion-matrix-NMO`  Contains data used to draw the confusion matrices that give the statistical separation between the true and test LRI symmetry contrasted pair-wise. Used in fog. 10.
  
2. `constraints-mass-coupling-plane-NMO` Contains data used to put upper limits on the new gauge boson mass vs. coupling plane. Used in fig. 7.

3. `constraints-potential-IMO` Contains data used to put upper limit on the LRI potential arising from various U(1)' symmetries considered. Data are for inverted neutrino mass ordering. Used in figs. D2 & D3, and table D1.

4. `constraints-potential-NMO` contains data used to put upper limit on the LRI potential arising from various U(1)' symmetries considered. Data are for normal neutrino mass ordering. Used in figs. 5, 6, and D1, and table D1.

5. `discovery-mass-coupling-plane-NMO` Contains data used to show our discovery prospects at 5 sigma C.L.. Neutrino mass ordering is assumed to be normal. Used in fig. 8. 

6. `discovery-potential-NMO` Contains data used for the discovery strength of LRI potential. Used in fig. E1 and table E1.
